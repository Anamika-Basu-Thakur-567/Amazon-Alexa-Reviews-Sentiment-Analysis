# Amazon-Alexa-Reviews-Sentiment-Analysis

## Description
In this project, sentiment analysis was performed on Amazon Alexa reviews to classify customer feedback into positive or negative sentiments. The process started with Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), where missing values were handled, and the distribution of feedback and ratings was explored using visualizations. This provided a clear understanding of the data structure and revealed patterns in customer sentiment towards Alexa products.

Feature engineering was applied to prepare the data for machine learning models. Several classification algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and ensemble methods, were implemented. Each model was optimized to improve its performance, and the best results were achieved by tuning hyperparameters using GridSearchCV, which resulted in an accuracy of 0.86 and an F1 score of 0.92. These insights allow Amazon to make data-driven decisions to enhance product experiences and customer satisfaction.
